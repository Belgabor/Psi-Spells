# Psi-Spells
Spells for Vazkii's Minecraft mod [Psi](http://psi.vazkii.us/index.php) ([Curse](http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/241665-psi))
You are completely free to use these spells any way you wish. Of course I appreciate a mention, but I don't require it =)

## Dig
These spells are 3x3 mining spells. In contrast to the popular one found at [http://pastebin.com/JHAg8JMA](http://pastebin.com/JHAg8JMA) (Author unknown to me), these work along all 3 axes but do require greater infusion. The spell ```dig``` is for CAD use and requires a CAD capable of complexity 25 and bandwidth 9. The ```dig tool``` spells are for use in Psimetal tools. Version ```A``` requires complexity 19 and bandwidth 8, ```B``` 23 and 7 respectively.

## Fertilize
First try at an area fertilize spell. Used with a circle spell bullet it will fertilize a 4 deep and 5 wide area to the right of the block you are targeting. Note: The spell uses the axial look vector of the caster to determine orientation. If you look away it will fertilize the wrong blocks. Also don't look mostly downwards or it will fail completely. Fixing this would make the spell a lot more complex than it is now.
