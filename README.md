# Psi-Spells
Spells for Vazkii's Minecraft mod [Psi](http://psi.vazkii.us/index.php) ([Curse](http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/241665-psi))
You are completely free to use these spells any way you wish. Of course I appreciate a mention, but I don't require it =)

## Dig
These spells are 3x3 mining spells. In contrast to the popular one found at [http://pastebin.com/JHAg8JMA](http://pastebin.com/JHAg8JMA) (Author unknown to me), these work along all 3 axes but do require greater infusion. The spell ```dig``` is for CAD use and requires a CAD capable of complexity 25 and bandwidth 9. The ```dig tool``` spells are for use in Psimetal tools. Version ```A``` requires complexity 19 and bandwidth 8, ```B``` 23 and 7 respectively.

Tested Psi vsersion: beta-11
